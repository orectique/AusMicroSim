## Overview

-   Background information

-   Data and preprocessing

-   Weighting and simulation

-   What do we see?

## What are the Stage 3 Tax Cuts?

##### From July 2024,

-   Increase the floor of the highest tax bracket from \$180,001 to \$200,001

-   Remove the bracket between \$120,001 and \$180,000, previously taxed at 37%

-   Introduce a new tax bracket between \$45,001 and \$200,00, to be taxed at 30%

## Datasets

Seed (Sample) - 2% Sample file (ATO, 2021)

Constraints (Margins) - Census of Population and Housing (ABS, 2021)

-   Limited by ABS Data Export size limitations

::: callout-note
```         
Taxable income (from seed) is assumed to be a good estimator of gross income (from constraints)

Individuals are assumed to have reported marrital status consistently.

```{dot}
digraph {
  rankdir=LR;
  node [shape=box];
  "Weighting (IPF)" -> "Create synthetic population" -> "Add continuous variables" -> "Add categorical variables" -> "Adjust synthetic population" -> "Simulate tax policies";
}
```

## Weighting and Creating synthetic population

-   Iterative proportional fitting (raking) was used to weigh individuals in the seed against known margins.

-   Individual characteristics - Age, Gender, Region, Partner (Boolean)

-   Horvitz--Thompson estimator

## Adding variables

-   Taxable income was added as a continuous variable using linear models with random error terms

-   Individual occupation was added as a categorical variable using xgboost

## Adjusting synthetic population

-   Simulate population at postcode level while respecting regional margins

-   Minimize differences between observed and simulated margins (Simulated Annealing)

    -   Randomly swap individuals

    -   If necessary, generate new individuals for replacement

## Simulate tax policies

-   Apply Stage 3 tax policy along with counterfactuals
